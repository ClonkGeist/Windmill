Caption=Preconfiguration: Work Environments
Desc1=In Windmill, you can specify isolated work environments for each of your projects. There are mainly three types of work environments: <strong>clonk directories</strong>, <strong>workspaces</strong> and <strong>repositories</strong>.
Desc2=<strong>Clonk directories</strong> are work environments, which represents - as the name suggests - clonk directories. This option is especially helpful, if you have multiple different versions of OpenClonk (stable, newest dev snapshot, super experimental branch X, etc.) and want an easy overview over these. Using the <strong>OpenClonk Manager</strong> in the navigation, you can easily switch between these versions and e.g. test your project under the newest version of OpenClonk to maintain compatibility.
