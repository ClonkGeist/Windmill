Caption=Preconfiguration: Clonk directory
Desc1=To be able to use essential Features of Windmill, you need to select an OpenClonk directory (containing an <strong>openclonk.exe</strong> file). It will be used to give you an overview of your scenarios and to join and start games.
Warning1=<strong>Warning:</strong> Each time Windmill starts, your whole clonk directory will be exploded. (all packed files will be unpacked) This is required so Windmill can work with your files. This is also true for every clonk directory which will be added later and <strong>gets selected using the OpenClonk Manager</strong>. (This may require a restart though)
Warning2=An exploded clonk directory will cause longer loading times for network games. If you don't want your main clonk directory exploded, use a seperate clonk directory for Windmill until there is a solution to (at least) read packed group files.
Desc2=Path to OpenClonk directory:
Desc3=Here you can manually select a c4group file. (which is also required) Usually Windmill will detects it automatically for you, but if this is not the case or if you want to use a different c4group file, you can set it here.
Desc4=The c4group file is required to pack/unpack/explode group files so Windmill can work with these.
Desc5=Path to c4group file:
