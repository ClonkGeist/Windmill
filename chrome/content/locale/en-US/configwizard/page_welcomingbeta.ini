Desc1=Welcome to the Windmill Public Betatest!
Desc2=This public beta version of Windmill gives you full access to the current development status of Windmill. Be aware, that Windmill is still in <em>beta status</em>, so there is a chance that major issues can occur. That being said, it is a good idea to use a seperated working directory for Windmill and to backup important files, though issues of this extend did not occur in the past.
