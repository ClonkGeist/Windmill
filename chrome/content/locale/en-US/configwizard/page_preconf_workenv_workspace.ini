Caption=Preconfiguration: Work Environments - Workspaces
Desc1=<strong>Workspaces</strong> are work environments, which should be created for seperated projects. It is also possible to nest these work environments, so you can create a sub work environment for a bigger project or if you want to have a group for smaller projects. (e.g. a group of multiple smaller modification of a project)
Desc2=Windmill requires a root directory where all your work environments that are not clonk directories will be saved.
Desc3=Workspace root directory:
Desc4=You can create new work environments using the "New"-Button inside the explorer navigation. It is also possible to unload work environments (in this case, they will <strong>not</strong> be removed but Windmill will skip loading them) and to import them again. You can also create links to older work environments which may be useful if you change your root directory. (They need to have a valid header file so Windmill can accept them as work environments)
ExperimentalNote1=<strong>Experimental:</strong> By checking this checkbox, you can activate an experimental polyfill (a workaround which emulates a feature that is currently not supported) for definition loading. If it is active, you don't need to import object definitions of your clonk directory into workspaces. When you start a scenario, Windmill searches your clonk directory (and parent workspaces), will detect which definitions are used and links them for a moment using absolute paths. After that, the paths will be resetted.
ExperimentalNote2=It needs to be mentioned that this feature has some issues: sometimes, the paths will not be resetted or the time frame until windmill resets the paths is too tight so OpenClonk does not load the correct definitions. This will probably be unchanged until there will be native support in OpenClonk.
