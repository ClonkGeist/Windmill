Caption=Preconfiguration: Work Environments - Repository (optional)
ExperimentalNote1=<strong>Experimental:</strong> The whole content of this page (the git implementation in Windmill) is experimental! There is only support for some basic functionality which is almost completely untested and serves as a basis for future development of this feature. It should be not expected to work very well.
Desc1=<strong>Repositories</strong> are a special kind of workspaces, which allows to use Git functionality inside your workspace. For this, you first need to clone the repository using Windmill. (already cloned directories cannot be used at the time of this writing) All further git operations can be acessed using the context menu (right click) on the work environment itself and on its contents.
Desc2=To use Git functionality inside of Windmill, you need to download and install Git on your computer and choose the "git.exe" file. (under "installation path\bin\git.exe") You can download the current verson of Git here: https://git-scm.com/downloads
