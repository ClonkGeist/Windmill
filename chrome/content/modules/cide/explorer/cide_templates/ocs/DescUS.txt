Gold Rush

Clonk geologists recently discovered that an ancient glacier deposited significant amounts of gold beneath the Forest of Orgos. Your expedition has set out to collect the reward buried deep below.

Goal: Gold idol construction and profit (gain clunkers to complete the scenario).

Hints:
- Multiple players can work cooperatively towards the goal.
- Gold bars or nuggets may be put into the flag for money.
- Gold bars are worth more than gold nuggets.
